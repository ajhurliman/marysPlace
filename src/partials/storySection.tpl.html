      <h4><strong>THE STORY</strong></h4>
      <h5><strong>LAUNCH DATE: NOV 16, 2016</strong></h5>
      <h5><strong>DEADLINE TO GIVE: DEC 31, 2016</strong></h5>
      <p>Tonight, 500 families will sleep outside in Seattle. Mostly single mothers with children, sleeping in places that are cold, wet, and unsafe.</p>
      <p>Please join our incredible launch supporters Amazon, Bank of America, Biscuit Bitch, Dick’s Drive-In Restaurants, Downtown Seattle Association, HomeStreet Bank, Lennar Multifamily Communities, Seattle Restaurant Alliance, Starbucks, Seattle Chamber of Commerce, Seattle Women’s Council of Realtors, and Zoots to help Mary&#39;s Place raise over $500,000 to open additional shelters in early 2017 to bring as many families inside at night as possible!</p>

      <p>With your help, we can make our goal of moving families out of encampments, doorways and cars and into safe, emergency shelter a reality!</p>

        <ul>
          <li>For every $10,000 we raise, 25 families can get the down payments they need to move in to transitional or permanent housing.</li>
          <li>$120,000 will provide over 10,000 nights of shelter for families currently sleeping outside.</li>
          <li>$250,000 &amp; we can fund our ongoing work to provide emergency shelter and services to the 400+ women and children who come to our door every day.</li>
          <li>$500,000 will pay for a crisis-response night shelter for one year to bring families experiencing homelessness inside to safety, and provide 36,000 additional bed nights for families in need next year (100 Beds)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>At Mary’s Place, we empower more than 400 homeless women, children, and families each night to reclaim their lives by providing shelter, nourishment, resources, healing and hope in a safe community.</p>

        <p>Help us make the third year of the No Child Sleeps Outside campaign the most successful yet! Together with our sponsors and generous community, we’ve raised over $750,000 the last two years and more than doubled our capacity from 150 shelter beds in 2014, to 400 today. Help us double that number again!</p>

        <p>Last year’s success allowed us to open the Mary’s Place Family Center in North Seattle, and the Mary’s Place Guest Rooms shelter in partnership with Amazon in South Lake Union!</p>
        
        <p>At Mary’s Place, a family experiencing homelessness begins their journey into permanent housing. We CAN bring our city’s 500 families inside and out of cars, bus stations, and doorways with YOUR HELP!</p>
        
        <p>We need to do more. TOGETHER we can bring these families – moms, dads, and children – inside to warmth and safety this winter.</p>
